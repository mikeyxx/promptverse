This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What is this project?

PromptVerse is an open-source AI prompting tool for modern world to discover, create and share creative prompts

**Please Note: The database for this project is hosted on a free Mongo Atlas tier so it may take a few minutes to load and display all data on the initial start**

### How does it work?

As a user, you can sign in using Google social sign in. Once signed in, you can click the "Create Post" button which will take you a page where you can enter your prompt and a corresponding tag and click on the "Create" button to save the post. Once saved, your post appears on the homepage where you and other users can view all created prompts. You can also delete or update your prompt by going to your profile where you will see "Delete" and "Edit" buttons if you are signed in. Users can also view a list of other users prompt by clicking on their name, email or avi on the homepage

## Set up the project

### Install Node and NPM

`npm` is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get `npm` installed on your computer. You can install Node by [downloading it from the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) or using a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on a macOS or Linux device or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) on a Windows device.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** This project requires the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Node. If you have an earlier version of Node, now would be a great time to upgrade!

### Install the projectâ€™s dependencies
